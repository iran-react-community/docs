Our goal is to add Persian to stack overflow 

- Authoring Persian documentation and providing educational programming related content
   in Farsi.
   
-   Make Iranian developers community feel comfortable using their native language for discussions and questioning their programming problems.

   
-   provide an open source structure through GitHub to initiate projects
   and discussions on modern web development technologies especially
   React JS.

This community gathered around trying to add the Persian language to StackOverflow.
