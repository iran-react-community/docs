#Git From Command Line
 
The command line is the only place you can run all Git commands, most of the GUIs implement only a partial subset of Git functionality for simplicity. 

##Tools


### Git

We need git to be install globaly on our system, [here](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.11/cmder_mini.zip "this is a project called Git for Windows") is the download link.

Another easy way to get Git installed is by installing GitHub Desktop. The installer includes a command line version of Git as well as the GUI.
You can download this from the [GitHub Desktop website](https://desktop.github.com/).



###Console Emulator 
We need a command prompt shell
####cmd.exe
Command Prompt, also known as **cmd.exe** or cmd (after its executable file name), is the Built-in command-line interpreter on Windows.

####GitBash
Git Bash installation is much simpler than compared to Linux. Download latest version of Git Bash from official website as per your system architecture. Use below link to download the Git Bash.

####Cmder
The main advantage of Cmder is portability. It is designed to be totally self-contained with no external dependencies, which makes it great for USB Sticks or cloud storage. So you can carry your console, aliases and binaries (like wget, curl and git) with you anywhere.

[Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.11/cmder_mini.zip "Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over absence of usable console emulator on Windows. It is based on ConEmu with major config overhaul, comes with a Monokai color scheme, amazing clink (further enhanced by clink-completions) and a custom prompt layout.") /
[wiki](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki#cmder-integration "While Cmder comes with ConEmu as the default console emulator, it can in fact work with many of the other terminals, such as Hyper, VS Code, and ConsoleZ. For the best experience, we suggest you integrate your favorite IDEs with Cmder – it makes your editor terminal work universally and as productive as Cmder itself. Cmder can also work best with bash on Windows. Bash is the default shell found *NIX systems such as Linux and macOS.") /
